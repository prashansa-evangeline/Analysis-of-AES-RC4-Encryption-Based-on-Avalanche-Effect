# Analysis-of-AES-RC4-Encryption-Based-on-Avalanche-Effect
In response to the escalating volume of data transmitted online, there is an urgent demand for innovative strategies to safeguard sensitive user information. The formidable task of securing such data becomes increasingly challenging as users engage in communication over public networks, where interception and theft pose significant threats, potentially leading to compromised privacy and financial repercussions. Cryptography emerges as a crucial tool in fortifying data security, primarily employing encryption to convert plaintext into ciphertext and decryption to revert ciphertext back to plaintext. However, the evolution of computing power renders traditional algorithms susceptible over time.

This research endeavors to introduce a pioneering hybrid cryptography architecture designed to bolster data protection. The proposed approach involves the integration of RC4 and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms for software encryption. The effectiveness of an algorithm is assessed through the avalanche effect, measuring the complexity of the encryption process. The strength of encryption is gauged by perturbing a single key bit and comparing the resultant ciphertext with the original. A greater disparity signifies enhanced encryption.

Our hybrid AES-RC4 implementation demonstrates a 50.59% bit-flip rate when modifying keys, attributed to the inherent characteristics of small file sizes. It is noteworthy that larger data files yield a higher discrepancy, indicating that the AES-RC4 hybrid outperforms both AES and RC4 in terms of avalanche effect and, consequently, encryption efficacy.
